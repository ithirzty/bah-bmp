# bah-bmp
This is a really simple library for handling **uncompressed (at least for now)** bitmaps.

## Testing
You can do `bah ./test.bah` to compile the test program.
When executing, the expected output is the following:
- `test.bmp` ![test 1](assets/test.bmp) (a 2x2 image with blue, green, red, white pixels)
- `test2.bmp` ![test 1](assets/test2.bmp) (a 2x2 image with blue, green, red, yellow pixels)
- `test3.bmp` ![test 1](assets/test3.bmp) (a 50x50 image with a pink rectangle and a borwn rectangle on top of it, all corners except theirs bottom right corner should be connected with green lines).
